This was the first frontpage site design for http://craftofelectronics.org. It was a quick static HTML job thrown up in less than an hour using an openly licensed template, and served its purpose for a few months.

It is now retired and has been replaced by https://github.com/craftofelectronics/craftofelectronics.github.com. Interested parties should go there to contribute.
